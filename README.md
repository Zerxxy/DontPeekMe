# DontPeekMe

DontPeekMe is an iOS application that can be used to add an extra level of security to messaging. It is end to end encrypted and blocks unauthorized users from viewing your messages by blurring them and requiring a re-authentication at given time intervals.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- MacOS version 10.13.6
- Xcode from the App Store 
- Most recent version of Cocoapods
    - Use the following command in a terminal window to install cocoapods
    - sudo gem install cocoapods

## Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

### Option 1: source files already on local machine
1. Open a terminal window and change directory to the Xcode project
2. Once inside the correct directory, run "pod install"
3. This will install the appropriate cocoapods to your directory
4. Open the "dontPeekMe.xcworkspace" file (white icon)
5. Select the play button in the upper left to run


### Option 2: Installing directly from git
1. Open Xcode
2. Select "Clone an existing project"
3. In the text field enter https://github.com/Zerxxy/DontPeekMe.git
4. Click Done
5. Open a terminal window and change directory to the cloned Xcode project
6. Once inside the correct directory, run "pod install"
7. After installing the cocoapods, go back to the Xcode window
8. Select the play button in the upper left to run

Both of these options will open an emulator where you can create an account and start messaging.
